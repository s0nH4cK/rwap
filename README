This is a simple bash script that sets up a rogue ap and sniffs traffic.
There are two modes of operation, normal mode (default) and twin mode
In normal mode, the rogue ap name is WLAN_XXXX, where X is an hex random,
unless it is specified by -e | --essid argument.
In twin mode, the script will prompt for the target ap using airodump, 
and it will clone it with the strongest signal as possible.
In both modes, the script will can run in verbose mode (default) or in quiet mode,
writing ettercap logs to a file.

Requires ettercap, sslstrip, airodump-ng (only in twin mode), airmon-ng (both included in aircrack suite),
macchanger and isc-dhcp-server.

 Usage is:
     rwap.sh -i <wireless_interface> [OPTIONS]
     -i | --interface <wireless_interface>	-- The interface of the wireless card to be used for mounting the rogue ap
     OPTIONS:
 		-d | --dhcpdconf <dhcpd.conf>	-- The dhcpd.conf configuration file
 		-e | --name <rogue ap name>	-- ESSID of the rogue ap
 		-h | --help			-- Show this help
 		-m | --mode <mode>		-- Mode operation: "normal" (default) and "twin"
 		-o | --output <file>		-- Ettercap output file
	
Examples:

Normal verbose mode: rwap.sh -i wlan0 -e free_wifi
Normal quiet mode: rwap.sh -i wlan0 -m normal -o outputfile
Twin verbose mode: rwap.sh -i wlan0 -m twin

There are probably much better solutions. However, you are free to test this one,
improve it, share it, or simply ignore it.
